# bevy-app

An application for organizing outdoor activities with friends, especially on short notice.

Oftentimes, when trying to organize outdoor activities such as hikes or bike rides, it can be difficult to know who else might be available to join. Instead of trying to round up friends or getting contact info for friends of friends, Bevy allows users to post events so that they are immediately available to other users.

Users can see events posted by other users whom they follow, and can choose to join them.
